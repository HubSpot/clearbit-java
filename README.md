# Clearbit

A Java API client to [https://clearbit.com](https://clearbit.com).

## Installation

You must currently checkout and build the source
TODO: deploy to Maven Central

## Usage

Authorize requests by setting the API key found on your [account's settings page](https://clearbit.com/keys).

```java
final String clearbit_key = System.getenv("CLEARBIT_KEY");

CompanyApi api = new CompanyApi();

api.getApiClient().setUsername(clearbit_key);

Company company = api.stream("clearbit.com");
```

The API is blocking by default - it holds a streaming connection open (this can take 3~5 seconds if we haven't seen the email before).

## Supported APIs

Currently streaming for the following APIs is supported:

* Person
* Company

We welcome pull requests to add support for other APIs and for webhooks.

## Implementation Notes

The base classes such as `ApiClient` were generated by swagger-codegen.

Lombok is used in the model classes to efficiently represent the models without boilerplate for getters, setters, toStrings, etc. The code is delomboked during compilation so that the final output does not include any dependency on Lombok.
